## Running the spring boot backend locally

1. Assure that a mongodb installation is running and reachable at `localhost:27017` (or whichever URL is set in `server/src/main/resources/application.properties`)

2. Run `cd server` followed by `mvn spring-boot:run`.

## Running the angular front end locally

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
